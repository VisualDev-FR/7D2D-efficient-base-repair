UI:
    ✔ setup UI into the TileEntity @done(24-05-22 23:58)
    ✔ on/off button @done(24-05-22 23:58)
    ✔ dynamic ratio of needed materials / available materials (with refresh button ?) @done(24-05-22 23:59)
    ☐ estimated time to repair all

Config:
    ✘ import `COOLDOWN` duration from config.xml @cancelled(24-05-21 17:36)
    ✔ import `MAX_ITERTIONS` for bfs from config.xml @done(24-05-21 00:35)
    ✔ import `NEEDS_MATERIAL` on/off from config.xml @done(24-05-21 00:35)
    ☐ import `IGNORED_BLOCKS` from config.xml
    ☐ import `LootSizeX` from config.xml
    ☐ import `LootSizeY` from config.xml
    ☐ remove `UpdateOnOpen` option (default=true)
    ☐ import `MaxReceivedPower` from config.xml
    ☐ import `PowerMultiplier` from config.xml

To be implemented (or not ?):
    ✘ Cooldown: a period of time during which no repair can be launched @cancelled(24-05-21 17:36)
    ✔ Better UI inside the loot container @done(24-05-21 00:35)
    ✔ RepairSpeed: an amount of damage which can be repaired in one UpdateTick event @done(24-05-22 23:59)
    ☐ electricity needed to launch a repair ?
    ☐ if electricity needed -> increase repair speed according to max received power ?
    ☐ make block ignoring in bfs more generic, by specifying explicit blocks to ignore.
    ☐ add upgrade option

Know issues (WIP):
    ☐ Spike blocks at stage Dmg1 or Dmg2 with block.damage = 0 are upgraded for free at stage Dmg0
