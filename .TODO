To be implemented (or not ?):
    ✘ Cooldown: a period of time during which no repair can be launched @cancelled(24-05-21 17:36)
    ✔ Better UI inside the loot container @done(24-05-21 00:35)
    ✔ RepairSpeed: an amount of damage which can be repaired in one UpdateTick event @done(24-05-22 23:59)
    ☐ electricity needed to launch a repair ?
    ☐ if electricity needed -> increase repair speed according to max received power ?
    ☐ make block ignoring in bfs more generic, by specifying explicit blocks to ignore.
    ☐ add upgrade option
    ☐ add boundHelper on damaged blocks
    ☐ find a way to avoid spamming the refresh button on server side
    ☐ find a way to change params without accessing xml files
    ☐ find a way to make the repairations slower

To be fixed:
    ✔ The loot container can be accessed by two players at the same time @done(24-05-29 20:26)
    ☐ Spike blocks at stage Dmg1 or Dmg2 with block.damage >= 0 are upgraded for free at stage Dmg0
    ☐ The tension of a repaired block is reseted

Check-List:
    ☐ auto-refresh can be disabled
    ☐ materials needs can be disabled
    ☐ auto repair can be disabled during bloodmoon
    ☐ repair rate can be modified
    ☐ bfs max iterations can be disabled
    ☐ two users can't access the crate at same time
    ☐ A block which miss at least one material to be repaired is not repaired
    ☐ An auto reparation does not change the paint applied on the block
    ☐ ...
